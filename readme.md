* Customizable prefix
* (WOW) <b>CREATE YOUR OWN COMMANDS WITH ZERO CODE!</b> Use commands.json to add your own custom commands, like `!discord` or `!bestgroup`, read [How to make commands](#CreatingCMDS) to setup.
* Discord integration coming soon™

[//]: # (* Commands for discord &#40;btw all the functional commands you can use in-game you can also use in discord&#41;:)
[//]: # (* `!raw` &#40;sends message in-game chat without a prefix&#41;)
[//]: # (* `!save` &#40;manually saves cache to the database&#41; &#40;its done every hour anyway, dev command&#41;)
[//]: # (* `!usercount` &#40;amount of players)
[//]: # (registered in the database, e.g., those who logged on at least once&#41;.)

## Setup
<b>Easy!</b>
1. Install Node JS and npm on your system (<a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">link</a>)
2. Download this repository, open the folder that it contains, open the terminal there.
3. Run `npm install`

### Configuring
To configure go to `config.json`
Things to change:
> `prefix` - what to use as a command prefix in in-game chat, like `!` or `?`.

> `commandInterval` - How often can this bot send text messages in chat.

> `discord_bot_private_key` - Your discord bot token for discord integration (coming soon™)

> `spammer` - Stuff to manage your spammer.
>   1. `min_spam_wait` - minimal time between messages (in minutes).
>   2. `max_spam_wait` - maximal time between messages (in minutes).
>   3. `messages` - list of messages that will be spammed by the bot.

### Running
To run the bot use this command: `[] = optional <> = required` 

`node bot.js [-microsoft (If is a migrated account)] <ip (ip of the server)> <port (port of the server, 25565 by default)> <username (minecraft username. Email if microsoft account)> <password (Account Password)>`

#### Running on Linux VM on session quit. (Advanced)
If you would like to run the bot on a Linux Server and be able to logout of the session you can use the Node Package "forever"

To install it run `sudo npm i forever -g`

Then to start the bot run `forever start bot.js [-microsoft (If is a migrated account)] <ip (ip of the server)> <port (port of the server, 25565 by default)> <username (minecraft username. Email if microsoft account)> <password (Account Password)>`

*Sadly to stop the bot you must restart your entire server as the Daemon does not close properly* 
   
## <p id="CreatingCMDS">Creating Custom Commands</p>
First go to `commands.json`, there is info in that file on how to create commands.


### Does it collect my data?

No, Unanmedbot will login to the minecraft account specified via the enviroment variables and then discard the login details.
As of writing this [Mineflayer](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/mineflayer/) does not store your data.

## Built With

* [Mineflayer](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/mineflayer/) - Node.JS package to connect to Minecaft servers.
* [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/) - The most common Discord Bot building frame work used by many bots.
